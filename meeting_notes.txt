November 5 - Meeting with Tiwa

Current LMs are open vocabulary - so they can express any word. So we need to specify
the content of our language model's vocab - otherwise, calls it <UNK>. Humans solve the problem
of segmenting words from speech.

Most LMs start by looking at a doc full of characters and iteratively merge into larger and
larger chunks that looks like words, then stop.

This project is taking a closer look at the way LMs are solving the problem and characterising
it in ways that we think humans solve this problem.
